# ServeSmart – Restaurant Management System

ServeSmart is a smart restaurant management system designed to modernize the ordering, payment, and management processes in restaurants. Customers can browse the menu, place orders, and make payments directly through the website, reducing the need for cashiers and minimizing waiter workload.
